    <h1>Potato Cakes</h1>
    <img src="../img/potato-cakes.jpg" alt="Delicous Potato Cakes">
    <p>According to history, this cake was adapted from frikadeller or frikadel in Dutch, which is a kind of minced meat that is compressed and then fried. This food was originally introduced by the Dutch when they colonized Indonesia. However, in Indonesia the main ingredient of this meat is replaced with ingredients from potatoes that are mashed, then fried.
